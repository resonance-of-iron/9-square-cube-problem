# 9-square-cube-problem
This is essentially a personal project for me, which basically has me teaching myself to solve rubix cube, make an algorithm for it on paper, then writing here a program in cpp(at first) and from there upgrade it from a text based solver to a visual step by step rubix cube solver where all you do is input the cubes initial state and whilst there may already be solvers out there i dont actually know and i will try very hard not to look, purely because this project is to get me to stop procrastinating with regards to programming, which i conveniently find excuses not to do, it is essentially an excercise in self discipline.
